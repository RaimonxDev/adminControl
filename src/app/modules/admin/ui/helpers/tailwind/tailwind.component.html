            <!-- Introduction -->
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                As per the official page of Tailwind CSS, it is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives you all of the building blocks you need to build bespoke
                designs without any annoying opinionated styles you have to fight to override.
            </p>
            <p>
                To simply put, Tailwind provides helper classes for almost every CSS rule available.
            </p>
            <p>
                Assembly includes Tailwind by default and it can be used in any part of the theme. Majority of Assembly's pages and apps still use the traditional styling with
                ids and classes but they can be easily improved and modified using Tailwind. If you choose to use Tailwind as your main styling framework and don't want to use
                traditional ids and classes for styling, you can always create apps and pages and use the helper classes from Tailwind to style them.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also choose to use Tailwind as a helper classes utility rather than your main style framework. Basically, you would still create id/class based styles
                for complex styling and layouts and use only certain parts of the Tailwind to modify your styles, like quickly adding <b>margin</b> and <b>padding</b> to the
                elements, or <b>showing</b> and/or <b>hiding</b> them based on breakpoints to create better mobile/table layouts without writing media queries all the time.
            </p>

            <!-- Configuration -->
            <h2>Configuration</h2>
            <p>
                To use Tailwind, you don't need to do any setup as all Tailwind classes can be accessible from any HTML file you create by default.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tailwind configuration can be found in <code>/src/app/configs/tailwind.ts</code> file. This file is used to configure the generated classes by Tailwind. We already
                configured the Tailwind using that file with the current breakpoints of the Assembly, more sizing options and couple other useful utilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                The generated scss file is located at the <code>/src/tailwind.scss</code> and it's being included as one of the main style files in the building process using
                <code>angular.json</code> configuration.
            </p>

            <!-- Building Tailwind -->
            <h2>Building Tailwind</h2>
            <p>
                If you modify the Tailwind configuration file to generate more classes or to simply edit the existing ones, you have to run the
                <code class="whitespace-no-wrap">npm run tw:build</code> command to build a new scss file with the new/modified styles. The Tailwind configuration file is not
                being watched by AngularCLI so any changes on that file <b>won't</b> trigger the Tailwind's building process automatically.
            </p>
